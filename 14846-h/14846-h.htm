    <h2>STUDIES IN THE NEW POETRY.</h2>

    <h3>No. III.</h3>

    <p>It is with the greatest possible pleasure that <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> presents to his readers the following example of the
    New Poetry. It is taken from a collection entitled "<i>Rhymes
    of the Ropes</i>" These Rhymes are intended to illustrate the
    everyday life of the British prize-fighter, his simple joys,
    his manly sorrows, his conversational excellences, and his
    indomitable pluck. The author has never been a prize-fighter
    himself, but he claims for these Rhymes the merit of absolute
    truth in every detail. In any case it is quite certain that
    every critic who reviews the volume will say of it, that no
    previous book has ever presented to us, with such complete
    fidelity, the British prize-fighter as he lives and moves, and
    has his being&mdash;not the gaudy, over-dressed and
    over-jewelled creature whom the imagination of the public
    pictures as haunting the giddy palaces of pleasure, and adored
    by the fairest of the fair, but the rough, uncouth, simple
    creature to whom we Britons owe our reputation for pluck and
    stamina. How the critic knows this, never having been a
    prize-fighter himself, and never having associated with them,
    is a question which it might be difficult to answer. But,
    nevertheless, the critic will guarantee the "<i>Rhymes of the
    Ropes</i>."</p>

    <p>If some of <i>Mr. Punch's</i> readers, while recognising the
    force and go of the lines, shall think them <i>tant soit
    peu</i> coarse and brutal, the fault must not be ascribed to
    <i>Mr. Punch</i>, but to the brilliant young author. Moreover,
    <i>Mr. Punch</i> begs leave to say, that squeamishness of that
    kind is becoming more and more absurd every day under the
    influence of the New Poetry and its professors. Here then
    is&mdash;</p>

    <p class="author"><i>The Bobolink, Henley.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>The Election at Sheepsdoor being regarded as a "moral" for
    our Candidate&mdash;(what a delightful change from the
    <i>im-moral</i> way in which elections <i>used</i> to be
    conducted!)&mdash;I felt it was safe for me to wing my flight
    to fresh scenes and pastures new!&mdash;not that I wanted any
    "new pastures," having been a <i>grass</i>-widow for some
    time;&mdash;but having had enough of the "rolling
    billow"&mdash;(by the way, the rolling "<i>Billow</i>" at
    Stockbridge didn't roll fast enough)&mdash;I yearned for the
    silvery smoothness of Father Thames, so started for Henley with
    my faithful <i>Eulalie</i>&mdash;(I really must change her
    name, it sounds like a Swiss jödel); but, oh! my
    goodness!&mdash;talk about <i>billows</i>&mdash;the Channel
    passage is a fool to what we found at Henley! Waves mountain
    high!&mdash;(This of course is an exaggeration, but I've read
    it so often in sea-novels, that I've almost come to believe it
    possible&mdash;it would be nearer the truth, as dear Mrs.
    RAMSBOTHAM would pronounce it, I fancy&mdash;waves "mounting
    high.") I had to sit all day on the roof of the
    <i>Bobolink</i>, with a lifebelt or <i>something</i> round my
    waist!&mdash;and having made me acquaintance of a sweet youth
    who could swim, I implored him not to leave me!&mdash;and he
    didn't&mdash;the whole day long. Ah! he was <i>very</i>
    nice!&mdash;I need not tell you I didn't notice the racing
    <i>much</i>, but I did take an interest in <i>two</i> of the
    contests; viz.&mdash;(I don't know what "viz." means&mdash;but
    I <i>do</i> know I am using it correctly)&mdash;The Diamond
    Sculls, and The Ladies' Challenge. The Diamonds were walked
    off, or rowed off to Holland&mdash;(great place, I'm told, for
    diamonds)&mdash;by Mr. K. OOMS (who evidently "kooms" of an
    athletic stock), amid the generous cheers of our defeated
    Englishmen! The other&mdash;and naturally, from its title, the
    most important event&mdash;was competed for by two boat-loads
    from Cambridge University&mdash;<i>Crews</i>, I believe, they
    call them, but I always thought it was a sign of contempt to
    allude to any party of people as "a crew." However that may be,
    I was informed that "First Trinity had carried off the Ladies!"
    (just as if they were a pack of Sabine women), and I suppose it
    was true; though, in counting up the Ladies in sight, I only
    missed <i>one</i>&mdash;and she, I found, had fallen into the
    river, and been gallantly rescued by a spectator, who, I
    presume, was determined to have <i>his</i> share, in spite of
    the First Trinity Men!</p>

    <p>Back to town, after all was over on Thursday, to find
    everybody wild with "election fever." A large group surrounding
    the "tape" at the Club (I belong to the "Amazon," of course),
    and ordering lemon squashes when a seat was lost, and whiskey
    and seltzer when the reverse was the case! Oh, this Election!
    Thank goodness, I'm off to Newmarket, to spend the week with
    Sir NEWMAN and Lady GATESHEAD, with a distinct feeling of
    relief at getting back to business after this fortnight of
    exciting relaxation!</p>

    <p>Next week's racing furnishes quite a lengthy <i>menu</i>,
    with several attractive <i>entrées</i>, and some good
    "made-up-overnight" dishes; in fact, a programme which appeals
    strongly to every racy palate. I do not propose to work my way
    through the entire <i>menu</i> (not being an Alderman), and
    will only hint at a few of the side-dishes, which may be worth
    attention reserving my great effort for the "<i>plat de
    résistance</i>" at Sandown; so, at Newmarket&mdash;try just a
    mouthful of July Handicap <i>à la</i> Duke of DEVONSHIRE's
    "Selected;" should it choke you, have a pat on the "Bach" when
    attacking the Beaufort <i>Stakes</i>; and to wind up with
    dessert, worthy of a CHESTERFIELD, take a "Meddler." If this
    conglomeration of good things is not too much for you, travel
    back to town in time for the great race of the week; but,
    <i>if</i> upset, don't blame,</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Première</i> of <i>Elaine</i>.
    BEMBERG Composer, LÉON-JEHIN Conductor, and Sir DRURIOLANUS
    Producer. Full House, determined to give New Opera a fair
    hearing, and sit it out. Don't get a new Opera every day.
    Congratulations to BEMBERG in a general way. "In a first Opera"
    (if this be his first), to quote the Composer of the recent
    De-La-ra-Boom Buddha, who was complacently listening to the
    other Composer's new Opera, "originality breeds contempt." So a
    little bit here, and a little bit there, here a bit, and there
    a bit, and everywhere a bit, gets rid of all superfluity in the
    Composer's brain, and saves the listening critic much trouble.
    Then his next Opera&mdash;Ah!&mdash;<i>that</i> ought to be all
    genuinely new and original Sparkling BEMBERG Cabinet.
    "<i>Elaine</i>," observed a lady critic, "is graceful and
    airy"&mdash;which, in the lady's presence, the present listener
    was not prepared to deny.</p>

    <p>Contented must have been Composer BEMBERG with such a cast
    as was made and provided for him by Sir DRURIOLANUS. MELBA, as
    the "Lily Maid of Astolat," charming, with a charming song,
    "<i>L'Amour est pur</i>." The audience was in an encoring
    humour, but, thank goodness, only a few encores were taken, and
    the others left, otherwise none of us would have been home till
    sunrise. In the swan-like dying scene the Composer wrings our
    heart-strings with his harp-strings, reminding everyone
    forcibly that, as <i>Mr. Guppy</i> observed, "There <i>are</i>
    chords!" Wagnerian, sometimes, is our BEMBERG, with his horns
    and brass. Fine chorus at beginning of Act II.&mdash;the
    Tournament Act&mdash;which shows, as a foolish person observed,
    "a Rummy lot at Camelot." At end of Third Act MELBA and JEAN DE
    RESZKÉ (who must have joined the Salvation Army, as he was,
    apparently, "saving himself" all the evening) were
    enthusiastically called. Engaged in curtseying her thanks,
    MELBA didn't notice&mdash;as, how should she?&mdash;property
    steps behind her, on which, at about her tenth curtsey, she
    suddenly sat down about two seconds before she could possibly
    realise that there was any chance of sitting down. But JEAN
    LAUNCELOT DE RESZKÉ was there, and rescued her! Good Knight!
    JEAN DE RESCUE! Then EDWARD, as <i>Hermit</i>, own brother to
    <i>Friar Laurence</i>, excellent. But so were they all, and the
    Opera will well repay several re-hearings.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<i>Aïda</i>. Generally considered
    rather a heavy Opera by VERDI. "But to-night," says WAGSTAFF,
    "the Verdi-ict quite t'other way." MAUREL excellent as
    <i>Amonasro</i>, and MAGGIE MACINTYRE looked, acted, and sang
    Maggie-nificently. Uncommonly good was GIULIA RAVOGLI as
    <i>Amneris</i>, <i>Aïda's</i> rival for the love of the
    small-sized <i>Radamès Dimitresco</i>, or Dimi-nutive-Tresco
    (comparatively speaking), to whom EDWARD DE RESZKÉ, being quite
    <i>a Ned</i> and shoulders taller, might spare some of his
    superfluous inches.</p>

    <p>EDWARD uncommonly good as <i>Ramfis</i>, which name,
    considering the peculiar make-up, might be appropriately
    changed to <i>Rum Phiz</i>, and nobody be any the worse.
    BEVIGNANI conducted himself and the orchestra admirably; M.
    PLANÇON, in English Plain Song, did all well that as <i>Il
    Re</i> he had to do, looking every inch a <i>Re</i>, and not a
    bit <i>Il</i>. Mlle. BAUERMEISTER was <i>Una Sacerdotissa</i>,
    but she would be anything and do everything well. Signer
    RINALDINI was <i>Un Messagiero</i>. His costume might have been
    more effective had Sir AUGUSTUS brought him up to date as a
    Messenger Boy for the Telephonie-sol-fa Company. This can be
    amended. House good.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Covent Garden, <i>Elaine</i> expected,
    but didn't appear. JOHN THE RISKY, the <i>Launcelot</i> of the
    Opera, unwell. "Not <i>Launcelot</i>, but another!" cried Sir
    DRURIOLANUS, only there wasn't another. So <i>Carmen</i> was
    played. "Not this <i>Elaine</i>," continued Sir AUGUSTUS, "but
    Drur-e-lane." So away! to hear the Trumpeter of the German
    Band. This <i>Trompeter</i> might be played as a trump in a
    small house, but 'tis trumpery for Drury Lane. One phrase of an
    old music-hall ditty, the words of which were, "She walked
    forward, <i>I</i> followed on, tra la la!" constantly recur.
    Who originated it? Unwonted excitement of going to two Operas
    told on shattered frame, so staggered to Maiden Lane, which, on
    account of its being the home for oysters, crabs, and lobsters,
    should be renamed Mer-maiden Lane. Behold! good Dr. BAYLIS
    "within the Rules" making up his evening prescriptions.
    "<i>Quis supperabit?</i>" asked the learned Dr. B.
    "<i>Ego</i>," replied I, like JEAMES, knowing the language. And
    "supper-a-bit" it was. "'84 <i>wachterum unum pintum frigidum

    <h2>MORE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ALCOHOLIC QUESTION.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A few remarks on Dr. Robson Roose's Article in New
    Review.</i>)</h4>

    <p>1. Inebriates should be shut up in Alcoholloway Prison.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:37%;">
        <a href="images/17-2.png"><img width="100%"

        <h4 class="sc">"'Neat' Handed Phyllis."</h4>"A contribution
        to the Alcohol Question."
    </div>

    <p>2. "<i>Food-accessory</i>" is a very pretty name for drink.
    Henceforth let the butler go round as "the merry toast goes
    round." Let butlers and footmen, in dining-rooms and places
    where they have various liquors, be instructed to inquire of
    each and every guest "What food-accessory will you take,
    Sir?"</p>

    <p>3. "<i>The use of Alcohol dates from very early times.</i>"
    But it is not recommended by the faculty as a good thing to be
    taken at 7 A.M., or at any time in the morning immediately on
    awaking.</p>

    <p>As to when any one has had enough "alcohol," the old test
    first put forward many years ago by <i>Mr. Punch</i>, still
    holds good. If you can say "British Constitution" distinctly,
    and without effort, so that it shall not be all in one
    composite word sounding like "Bri'sh-conshushun," then,
    perhaps, you may go up-stairs (if you can) and join the
    ladies.</p>

    <p>4. "<i>The liver is very prone to become affected.</i>" The
    question is, first, Is "an evil liver" or "a good liver" here
    intended? But, apart from this, any affectation in a liver,
    good or bad, is objectionable. It must be taken for granted, in
    a serious discussion on the subject, that "a slave to his
    liver" is a synonym for "a livery servant." The one objection
    to a livery servant lies in this very fact; for a slave to
    liver is rarely in a good humour, and is generally sulky, lazy,
    and disobliging.</p>

    <p>5. "<i>Wine comes in, rubs off the acerbities, and brings
    all down to the same level of good humour.</i>" The end of such
    a happy party is, of course, all under the table, smiling, but
    speechless.</p>

    <p>Dr. ROBERTS, as quoted by his <i>confrère</i>, ROBSON
    ROOSETEM PASHA, appears to be a very sensible person. Dr.
    ROBERTS&mdash;he is not Dr. ARTHUR ROBERTS, we
    believe&mdash;recommends the liqueur to be judiciously taken at
    meal-times. And, by the way, as the knowledge of when to cry,
    "Hold, enough!" is most useful, here is another test of
    sobriety in this very word "judicious," which some, after a
    couple of glasses (or more) of fine old cognac, will pronounce
    as though 'twere spelt "seducious," and some will swear it
    ought to be "jusidious." When nobody can pronounce "judicious"
    correctly, the <i>arbiter bibendi</i>, if himself absolutely
    sober as a judge ought to be,&mdash;a man quite "above-board,"
    <i>i.e.</i>, not yet under it,&mdash;such a one may pronounce
    that the guests have had quite enough. It is a pity that so
    excellent a writer on temperance should have the singular
    disadvantage of a plural name. If, after dinner, a worthy
    convivialist observed, "I see ROBERTS," would not the question
    naturally be, "How many of 'em?" The Doctor can omit the "s,"
    and, as perhaps he is already a little singular in his
    carefully-advanced theories, why should he not de-pluralise his
    surname? Do the Doctors R.R. and R. differ on this? Then we
    must decide. In the meantime, to show our approval of this
    particular article of Dr. ROBSON ROOSTEM PASHA's faith, we, as
    a jovial company, drink his health, and then depart for our
    annual Alcoholiday trip.</p>

    <p>It was shortly after the middle of July, 1892, that the
    Great Representative of the British Race stood upon the
    Victoria Embankment, watching the river-steamers as they passed
    to and fro. There were few persons about, for the General
    Election was over, and civilised London was out of Town. Some
    of civilised London had gone abroad, some were in Scotland,
    some by the Sea. So the Great Representative expected to see no
    one.</p>

    <p>"<i>Mr. Punch</i>, I believe!" said some one, approaching
    the Great Representative. The speaker was a person who wore a
    garb peculiarly suitable to the autumnal sultriness of the
    weather. He had about a couple of yards of calico, and one good
    coating of serviceable paint. The Great Representative bowed
    his head, and by a gesture, invited further explanation.</p>

    <p>"I am connected with the literary world, and am a Colonist.
    I am known, or used to be known (for I am getting a trifle out
    of date), as Lord MACAULAY's New-Zealander."</p>

    <p>Again the Great Representative bowed. He knew his visitor,
    and bade him welcome. Then he asked him the cause of his
    visit.</p>

    <p>"Well, I really don't know," replied the New-Zealander, with
    a short laugh. "I am afraid I must have been hoaxed. I was told
    that England was absolutely ruined, and was looking for a
    comfortable seat amongst the remains of London Bridge."</p>

    <p>"You see you are slightly premature," returned the Great
    Representative, pointing towards a more or less majestic pile
    in the offing. "There was some talk of rebuilding the structure
    some short while ago, but a viaduct near the Tower was
    considered preferable. When it is opened, there will be
    Knighthoods for the Sheriffs, and a Baronetcy for the Lord
    MAYOR."</p>

    <p>"And yet," pondered the New-Zealander, "I was certainly
    informed by wire, that the glory of Britain had vanished for
    ever."</p>

    <p>"Very likely an Election cry," observed <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
    "In the midst of a contested polling, both sides think the
    success of their rivals must be followed by immediate disaster.
    But somehow or other, things settle down afterwards, and
    nothing comes of it. Whichever side wins, the old flag floats
    in the wind as gaily and as prosperously as ever."</p>

    <p>"And yet I was certainly told that the sun of England had
    set never to rise again," persisted the Aboriginal, who seemed
    to be of an obstinate turn of mind. "Now I remember&mdash;the
    cause was something to do with Diamonds and Henley. Stay, the
    bright brains of the nation had disappeared. I recollect, the
    Diamond Sculls of the nation (once so great) had passed to
    foreigners."</p>

    <p>"Ah, now I take your meaning." said the National
    Representative, with a smile, "and you must have heard of the
    result of the race for the Diamond Sculls at Henley."</p>

    <p>"That must be it," acquiesced the New-Zealander. "I had
    forgotten to take into account possible errors in transmission.
    But tell me, has there been a national defeat?"</p>

    <p>"Well, yes," admitted <i>Mr. Punch</i>, with a
    sigh&mdash;"we did not come out altogether satisfactorily. Even
    the second man was a Frenchman&mdash;albeit, his name was
    suggestive of dear old Scotland."</p>

    <p>"And do you mean to say," said the New-Zealander, "that the
    best scullers of England were beaten by a boating-man from the
    Seine?"</p>

    <p>"It is too true, and the Frenchman himself succumbed to a
    Dutchman&mdash;yes, we confess it, and with shame."</p>

    <p>"I don't see why you should," returned the other, changing
    his tone to one of greater satisfaction. "As a New-Zealander, I
    observe nothing degrading in the superiority of Old Holland."
    And considering the prowess of VAN TROMP in the past, there was
    perhaps nothing so strange in the triumph of OOMS in the
    present.</p>

    <h2>"TO PAY OR NOT TO PAY, THAT IS THE BISLEYNESS."</h2>

    <p>MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I see that the receipts of the
    National Rifle Association have fallen off, and that there is a
    proposal to make the Bisley Meeting this year rather more
    attractive than its predecessors. The Camp is to be open, and
    there are to be Concerts and other distractions. But is this
    enough? Once confess that Rifle-shooting is not the sole
    business of the gathering, and the way is cleared for more
    amusing items. All that is wanted to convert a semi-failure
    into a triumphant success, is a Manager who could combine
    entertainment with instruction, thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>6 A.M.&mdash;Gun-fire. The Camp awakes, and, to the music of
    the band, gets up. Reserved seats in band-enclosure, sixpence
    extra.</p>

    <p>7 A.M.&mdash;Balloon Ascent. Firing at the sun with
    revolvers by trained aëronauts. Seats in parachutes, five
    shillings a-piece.</p>

    <p>8 A.M.&mdash;Early performance of BUFFALO BILL before his
    departure for Earl's Court. Prices as usual.</p>

    <p>9 A.M.&mdash;Sham Fight, augmented by Menagerie from
    Travelling Circus. Cards to visit the stables,
    half-a-crown.</p>

    <p>10 A.M.&mdash;Representation of Siege Scene from Venice in
    London, under the title of "The Bridge of Sighs within
    measuring distance of Woking Cemetery." Season tickets,
    half-a-guinea.</p>

    <p>11 A.M.&mdash;Performance of the Battle of Waterloo by
    veterans, late of Astley's Theatre. Families and schools
    half-price.</p>

    <p>12 NOON.&mdash;Visit of Royalty, and Presentation of Purses.
    No Purse accepted containing less than two pounds ten.</p>

    <p>1 P.M.&mdash;Grand Luncheon, with speeches by the leading
    Military Authorities, followed by a Smoking Concert.
    One-and-sixpence.</p>

    <p>2 P.M.&mdash;Variety Show, including several of the best
    Lion Comiques, and the astounding performances of the Bounding
    Brothers of Bohemia. Stalls, ten shillings. Soldiers in uniform
    admitted at a considerable reduction.</p>

    <p>3 P.M.&mdash;Cricket Match between the famous Clown Eleven
    <i>versus</i> the Ladies' Sixteen. Grand Stand,
    three-and-six.</p>

    <p>4 P.M.&mdash;Comic Carnival, entitled, "Rollicksome
    Riflemen, or the Vicissitudes of the Volunteers." Reserved
    Seats, ninepence.</p>

    <p>There, my dear Sir, I think I have written enough. If there
    was any time to spare, the shooting programme might still be
    carried out; but business is business, and only by the means I
    have indicated (in my opinion) can Bisley be made to pay.
    Trusting that my suggestion may be accepted in the spirit in
    which it is offered, I remain,</p>

        appropriated to the Common Law Division of the High Court
        of Justice. At each of the doors of the Court where the
        Great Trial of</i> Arkass <i>v.</i> Arkass and
        Ambo&mdash;<i>which abounds in "scandalous revelations in
        High Life"&mdash;is proceeding, a group of would-be
        auditors has collected, waiting with the patience of
        respectable Peris for a chance of admission to the forensic
        Paradise within. The Paradise, at present, is full to
        overflowing, and the doors are guarded by a couple of
        particularly stern and stolid attendants. Each Peri is
        trying to wear out the endurance of the rest, and to
        propitiate the doorkeepers by exemplary behaviour.</i></p>

    the smoothly-chaste and insipidly-correct verses which our

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
